"""Submission API endpoints.

SECURITY MODEL:
- Miners submit code via API (POST /api/submissions)
- Validator stores code in PRIVATE R2 bucket
- Miners receive only submission_id (no storage details)
- Miners can check status (GET /api/submissions/{id})
- Storage credentials never exposed to miners

This prevents miners from:
- Accessing other miners' code
- Manipulating storage
- Seeing internal evaluation details
